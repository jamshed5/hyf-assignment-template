1. Three new things learned from AI:

How to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into external files for cleaner structure.

Using Flexbox and responsive design to center content and make it mobile-friendly.

Applying font weights and sizes in body for consistent, readable typography.

2. Tweaks/corrections to Copilotâ€™s suggestions:

Moved font-size from * selector to body for better scaling.

Adjusted list item spacing and padding for readability.

Modified paragraph text structure to make it clearer and more engaging for users

3. Copilot: code generator vs. learning partner:

As a generator: produces working code quickly.

As a learning partner: You review, tweak, and understand the code, which builds deeper skills and problem-solving ability.

4. Three risks of relying too much on AI at HackYourFuture:

You may copy code without fully understanding it.

It can create dependency, reducing problem-solving practice.

AI suggestions may contain subtle errors or bad practices if not reviewed carefully.
